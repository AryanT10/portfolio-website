	<h5>LEARNER - WEB DEVELOPER</h5>
	<p>I'm eager to start a career as a junior web developer in the quick-paced and constantly changing field of web development. I am qualified to design websites that are both aesthetically pleasing and useful since I have a background in programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm excited to keep growing and learning new things, both via formal education and real-world experience. To give clients and their audiences the greatest possible user experience as I traverse this dynamic sector, I am devoted to remaining up to date with new technology and best practises.</p>
